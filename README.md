# Advent of Code 2020 solutions

This repository contains all the code I used to solve the challenges
in the [Advent of code 2020](https://www.adventofcode.com).

I have chosen to use Java because that is what I am currently working with
for my study Technical Computer Science at the 
[Technical University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/). 
Furthermore, I have tried to stay as close as possible to the coding style 
and other rules enforced at my university.
